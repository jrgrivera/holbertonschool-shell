Elizabeth it is in vain you say
Love not"—thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,
Breath it less gently forth—and veil thine eyes.
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried
To cure his love—was cured of all beside—
His follie—pride—and passion—for he died.

For all the joys and all the grief
Of shared love from a time ago
Reaching deep into your amber 
Eyes still filled with you sparkle
Vying for that young, zesty rev
Even, as your Muscles do wane
Resting on your laurels,  Never

In you have I become a new i
Nourished, by all youâ€™ve sown

Youâ€™ve colored richly our tapestry
On waves strung highest soprano 
Undulating uniquely~me and you
Resplendence in our duetâ€™s quiver

Ever more a part of my psyche
Your spirit, will be my memory
Entwined always, this embrace
Surely, our soulsâ€™ best oneness
